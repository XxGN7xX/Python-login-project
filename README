This project is basic and sends you to the github page - you can edit it to go to your personal page and make a personal username and password. When I was knew to python (I'm new to github) I wanted to do this so I hope that there are some greatful beginners that would like to download this work. Regards - Developer â˜º (Also the project will be up tomorrow, 21 February which will probably have gone by by the time you view this project)
